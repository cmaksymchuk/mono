Tips to prepare for the interview
1. No need to stress yourself for complex data structures and algorithms
2. You are allowed to use the internet and check any documentation as no one can remember the syntax completely.
3. Make sure you focus a lot of TDD. I think every interviewer expects that you share some set of extensive test cases/path before writing the code.
4. Don't forget to tell them in detail why are you making each class and method. I tried to explain while coding but in the feedback, I was not vocal enough.
